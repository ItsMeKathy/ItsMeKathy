- Hi there :wave::relaxed: I’m Katharina (aka @ItsMeKathy), currently a Master Student of Applied Computer Science.
- I’m currently learning about outlier detection and machine learning based outlier prediction while writing my Master thesis :mortar_board:.
- At the moment, my favourite languages to code in are R, python and java.
- When I am not coding, I like to dabble in AI generated art :art::computer: (see my profile picture :wink:) and sewing :thread:, read a good book :closed_book: or be outdoors :deciduous_tree: (walking/hiking/running).
